<h1>THE O&rsquo;CONORS OF CASTLE CONOR, COUNTY MAYO.</h1>
<p>I <span class="smcap">shall</span> never forget my first
introduction to country life in Ireland, my first day&rsquo;s
hunting there, or the manner in which I passed the evening
afterwards.&nbsp; Nor shall I ever cease to be grateful for the
hospitality which I received from the O&rsquo;Conors of Castle
Conor.&nbsp; My acquaintance with the family was first made in
the following manner.&nbsp; But before I begin my story, let me
inform my reader that my name is Archibald Green.</p>
<p>I had been for a fortnight in Dublin, and was about to proceed
into county Mayo on business which would occupy me there for some
weeks.&nbsp; My head-quarters would, I found, be at the town of
Ballyglass; and I soon learned that Ballyglass was not a place in
which I should find hotel accommodation of a luxurious kind, or
much congenial society indigenous to the place itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are a hunting man, you say,&rdquo; said old Sir
P&mdash; C&mdash;; &ldquo;and in that case you will soon know Tom
O&rsquo;Conor.&nbsp; Tom won&rsquo;t let you be dull.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d write you a letter to Tom, only he&rsquo;ll certainly
make you out without my taking the trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did think at the time that the old baronet might have
written the letter for me, as he had been a friend of my
father&rsquo;s in former days; but he did not, and I started for
Ballyglass with no other introduction to any one in the county
than that contained in Sir P&mdash;&rsquo;s promise that I should
soon know Mr. Thomas O&rsquo;Conor.</p>
<p>I had already provided myself with a horse, groom, saddle and
bridle, and these I sent down, en avant, that the Ballyglassians
might know that I was somebody.&nbsp; Perhaps, before I arrived
Tom O&rsquo;Conor might learn that a hunting man was coming into
the neighbourhood, and I might find at the inn a polite note
intimating that a bed was at my service at Castle Conor.&nbsp; I
had heard so much of the free hospitality of the Irish gentry as
to imagine that such a thing might be possible.</p>
<p>But I found nothing of the kind.&nbsp; Hunting gentlemen in
those days were very common in county Mayo, and one horse was no
great evidence of a man&rsquo;s standing in the world.&nbsp; Men
there as I learnt afterwards, are sought for themselves quite as
much as they are elsewhere; and though my groom&rsquo;s top-boots
were neat, and my horse a very tidy animal, my entry into
Ballyglass created no sensation whatever.</p>
<p>In about four days after my arrival, when I was already
infinitely disgusted with the little Pot-house in which I was
forced to stay, and had made up my mind that the people in county
Mayo were a churlish set, I sent my horse on to a meet of the
fox-hounds, and followed after myself on an open car.</p>
<p>No one but an erratic fox-hunter such as I am,&mdash;a
fox-hunter, I mean, whose lot it has been to wander about from
one pack of hounds to another,&mdash;can understand the
melancholy feeling which a man has when he first intrudes
himself, unknown by any one, among an entirely new set of
sportsmen.&nbsp; When a stranger falls thus as it were out of the
moon into a hunt, it is impossible that men should not stare at
him and ask who he is.&nbsp; And it is so disagreeable to be
stared at, and to have such questions asked!&nbsp; This feeling
does not come upon a man in Leicestershire or Gloucestershire
where the numbers are large, and a stranger or two will always be
overlooked, but in small hunting fields it is so painful that a
man has to pluck up much courage before he encounters it.</p>
<p>We met on the morning in question at Bingham&rsquo;s
Grove.&nbsp; There were not above twelve or fifteen men out, all
of whom, or nearly all were cousins to each other.&nbsp; They
seemed to be all Toms, and Pats, and Larrys, and Micks.&nbsp; I
was done up very knowingly in pink, and thought that I looked
quite the thing, but for two or three hours nobody noticed
me.</p>
<p>I had my eyes about me, however, and soon found out which of
them was Tom O&rsquo;Conor.&nbsp; He was a fine-looking fellow,
thin and tall, but not largely made, with a piercing gray eye,
and a beautiful voice for speaking to a hound.&nbsp; He had two
sons there also, short, slight fellows, but exquisite
horsemen.&nbsp; I already felt that I had a kind of acquaintance
with the father, but I hardly knew on what ground to put in my
claim.</p>
<p>We had no sport early in the morning.&nbsp; It was a cold
bleak February day, with occasional storms of sleet.&nbsp; We
rode from cover to cover, but all in vain.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
sorry, sir, that we are to have such a bad day, as you are a
stranger here,&rdquo; said one gentleman to me.&nbsp; This was
Jack O&rsquo;Conor, Tom&rsquo;s eldest son, my bosom friend for
many a year after.&nbsp; Poor Jack!&nbsp; I fear that the
Encumbered Estates Court sent him altogether adrift upon the
world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may still have a run from Poulnaroe, if the
gentleman chooses to come on,&rdquo; said a voice coming from
behind with a sharp trot.&nbsp; It was Tom O&rsquo;Conor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherever the hounds go, I&rsquo;ll follow,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come on to Poulnaroe,&rdquo; said Mr.
O&rsquo;Conor.&nbsp; I trotted on quickly by his side, and before
we reached the cover had managed to slip in something about Sir
P. C.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the deuce!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;What! a
friend of Sir P&mdash;&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Why the deuce didn&rsquo;t
you tell me so?&nbsp; What are you doing down here?&nbsp; Where
are you staying?&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>At Poulnaroe we found a fox, but before we did so Mr. O&rsquo;
Conor had asked me over to Castle Conor.&nbsp; And this he did in
such a way that there was no possibility of refusing
him&mdash;or, I should rather say, of disobeying him.&nbsp; For
his invitation came quite in the tone of a command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come to us of course when the day is
over&mdash;and let me see; we&rsquo;re near Ballyglass now, but
the run will be right away in our direction.&nbsp; Just send word
for them to send your things to Castle Conor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re all about, and unpacked,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind.&nbsp; Write a note and say what you want
now, and go and get the rest to-morrow yourself.&nbsp; Here,
Patsey!&mdash;Patsey! run into Ballyglass for this gentleman at
once.&nbsp; Now don&rsquo;t be long, for the chances are we shall
find here.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, after giving some further
hurried instructions he left me to write a line in pencil to the
innkeeper&rsquo;s wife on the back of a ditch.</p>
<p>This I accordingly did.&nbsp; &ldquo;Send my small
portmanteau,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and all my black dress
clothes, and shirts, and socks, and all that, and above all my
dressing things which are on the little table, and the satin
neck-handkerchief, and whatever you do, mind you send my
<i>pumps</i>;&rdquo; and I underscored the latter word; for Jack
O&rsquo;Conor, when his father left me, went on pressing the
invitation.&nbsp; &ldquo;My sisters are going to get up a
dance,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and if you are fond of that kind of
things perhaps we can amuse you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now in those days I
was very fond of dancing&mdash;and very fond of young ladies too,
and therefore glad enough to learn that Tom O&rsquo;Conor had
daughters as well as sons.&nbsp; On this account I was very
particular in underscoring the word pumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And hurry, you young divil,&rdquo; Jack O&rsquo;Conor
said to Patsey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told him to take the portmanteau over on a
car,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; then you&rsquo;ll find it there on our
arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had an excellent run, in which I may make bold to say that
I did not acquit myself badly.&nbsp; I stuck very close to the
hounds, as did the whole of the O&rsquo;Conor brood; and when the
fellow contrived to earth himself, as he did, I received those
compliments on my horse, which is the most approved praise which
one fox-hunter ever gives to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll buy that fellow of you before we let you
go,&rdquo; said Peter, the youngest son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I advise you to look sharp after your money if you sell
him to my brother,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>And then we trotted slowly off to Castle Conor, which,
however, was by no means near to us.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have ten
miles to go;&mdash;good Irish miles,&rdquo; said the
father.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I ever remember a
fox from Poulnaroe taking that line before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t a Poulnaroe fox,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that;&rdquo; said Jack; and then
they debated that question hotly.</p>
<p>Our horses were very tired, and it was late before we reached
Mr. O&rsquo;Conor&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; That getting home from
hunting with a thoroughly weary animal, who has no longer
sympathy or example to carry him on, is very tedious work.&nbsp;
In the present instance I had company with me; but when a man is
alone, when his horse toes at every ten steps, when the night is
dark and the rain pouring, and there are yet eight miles of road
to be conquered,&mdash;at such time a man is almost apt to swear
that he will give up hunting.</p>
<p>At last we were in the Castle Conor stable yard;&mdash;for we
had approached the house by some back way; and as we entered the
house by a door leading through a wilderness of back passages,
Mr. O&rsquo;Conor said out loud, &ldquo;Now, boys, remember I sit
down to dinner in twenty minutes.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then turning
expressly to me, he laid his hand kindly upon my shoulder and
said, &ldquo;I hope you will make yourself quite at home at
Castle Conor, and whatever you do, don&rsquo;t keep us waiting
for dinner.&nbsp; You can dress in twenty minutes, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In ten!&rdquo; said I, glibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well.&nbsp; Jack and Peter will show you
your room,&rdquo; and so he turned away and left us.</p>
<p>My two young friends made their way into the great hall, and
thence into the drawing-room, and I followed them.&nbsp; We were
all dressed in pink, and had waded deep through bog and
mud.&nbsp; I did not exactly know whither I was being led in this
guise, but I soon found myself in the presence of two young
ladies, and of a girl about thirteen years of age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sisters,&rdquo; said Jack, introducing me very
laconically; &ldquo;Miss O&rsquo;Conor, Miss Kate O&rsquo;Conor,
Miss Tizzy O&rsquo;Conor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is not Tizzy,&rdquo; said the younger;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s Eliza.&nbsp; How do you do, sir?&nbsp; I hope
you had a fine hunt!&nbsp; Was papa well up, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack did not condescend to answer this question, but asked one
of the elder girls whether anything had come, and whether a room
had been made ready for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; said Miss O&rsquo;Conor; &ldquo;they
came, I know, for I saw them brought into the house; and I hope
Mr. Green will find everything comfortable.&rdquo;&nbsp; As she
said this I thought I saw a slight smile steal across her
remarkably pretty mouth.</p>
<p>They were both exceedingly pretty girls.&nbsp; Fanny the elder
wore long glossy curls,&mdash;for I write, oh reader, of bygone
days, as long ago as that, when ladies wore curls if it pleased
them so to do, and gentlemen danced in pumps, with black
handkerchiefs round their necks,&mdash;yes, long black, or nearly
black silken curls; and then she had such eyes;&mdash;I never
knew whether they were most wicked or most bright; and her face
was all dimples, and each dimple was laden with laughter and
laden with love.&nbsp; Kate was probably the prettier girl of the
two, but on the whole not so attractive.&nbsp; She was fairer
than her sister, and wore her hair in braids; and was also
somewhat more demure in her manner.</p>
<p>In spite of the special injunctions of Mr. O&rsquo;Conor
senior, it was impossible not to loiter for five minutes over the
drawing-room fire talking to these houris&mdash;more especially
as I seemed to know them intimately by intuition before half of
the five minutes was over.&nbsp; They were so easy, so pretty, so
graceful, so kind, they seemed to take it so much as a matter of
course that I should stand there talking in my red coat and muddy
boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well; do go and dress yourselves,&rdquo; at last said
Fanny, pretending to speak to her brothers but looking more
especially a me.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know how mad papa will
be.&nbsp; And remember Mr. Green, we expect great things from
your dancing to-night.&nbsp; Your coming just at this time is
such a Godsend.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again that soup&ccedil;on of a
smile passed over her face.</p>
<p>I hurried up to my room, Peter and Jack coming with me to the
door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is everything right?&rdquo; said Peter,
looking among the towels and water-jugs.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve given you a decent fire for a wonder,&rdquo;
said Jack, stirring up the red hot turf which blazed in the
grate.&nbsp; &ldquo;All right as a trivet,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And look alive like a good fellow,&rdquo; said Jack.&nbsp;
We had scowled at each other in the morning as very young men do
when they are strangers; and now, after a few hours, we were
intimate friends.</p>
<p>I immediately turned to my work, and was gratified to find
that all my things were laid out ready for dressing; my
portmanteau had of course come open, as my keys were in my
pocket, and therefore some of the excellent servants of the house
had been able to save me all the trouble of unpacking.&nbsp;
There was my shirt hanging before the fire; my black clothes were
spread upon the bed, my socks and collar and handkerchief beside
them; my brushes were on the toilet table, and everything
prepared exactly as though my own man had been there.&nbsp; How
nice!</p>
<p>I immediately went to work at getting off my spurs and boots,
and then proceeded to loosen the buttons at my knees.&nbsp; In
doing this I sat down in the arm-chair which had been drawn up
for me, opposite the fire.&nbsp; But what was the object on which
my eyes then fell;&mdash;the objects I should rather say!</p>
<p>Immediately in front of my chair was placed, just ready for
may feet, an enormous pair of shooting-boots&mdash;half-boots
made to lace up round the ankles, with thick double leather
soles, and each bearing half a stone of iron in the shape of
nails and heel-pieces.&nbsp; I had superintended the making of
these shoes in Burlington Arcade with the greatest
diligence.&nbsp; I was never a good shot; and, like some other
sportsmen, intended to make up for my deficiency in performance
by the excellence of my shooting apparel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Those
nails are not large enough,&rdquo; I had said; &ldquo;nor nearly
large enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; But when the boots came home they
struck even me as being too heavy, too metalsome.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He, he, he,&rdquo; laughed the boot boy as he turned them
up for me to look at.&nbsp; It may therefore be imagined of what
nature were the articles which were thus set out for the
evening&rsquo;s dancing.</p>
<p>And then the way in which they were placed!&nbsp; When I saw
this the conviction flew across my mind like a flash of lightning
that the preparation had been made under other eyes than those of
the servant.&nbsp; The heavy big boots were placed so prettily
before the chair, and the strings of each were made to dangle
down at the sides, as though just ready for tying!&nbsp; They
seemed to say, the boots did, &ldquo;Now, make haste.&nbsp; We at
any rate are ready&mdash;you cannot say that you were kept
waiting for us.&rdquo;&nbsp; No mere servant&rsquo;s hand had
ever enabled a pair of boots to laugh at one so completely.</p>
<p>But what was I to do?&nbsp; I rushed at the small portmanteau,
thinking that my pumps also might be there.&nbsp; The woman
surely could not have been such a fool as to send me those tons
of iron for my evening wear!&nbsp; But, alas, alas! no pumps were
there.&nbsp; There was nothing else in the way of covering for my
feet; not even a pair of slippers.</p>
<p>And now what was I to do?&nbsp; The absolute magnitude of my
misfortune only loomed upon me by degrees.&nbsp; The twenty
minutes allowed by that stern old paterfamilias were already gone
and I had done nothing towards dressing.&nbsp; And indeed it was
impossible that I should do anything that would be of
avail.&nbsp; I could not go down to dinner in my stocking feet,
nor could I put on my black dress trousers, over a pair of
mud-painted top-boots.&nbsp; As for those iron-soled
horrors&mdash;; and then I gave one of them a kick with the side
of my bare foot which sent it half way under the bed.</p>
<p>But what was I to do?&nbsp; I began washing myself and
brushing my hair with this horrid weight upon my mind.&nbsp; My
first plan was to go to bed, and send down word that I had been
taken suddenly ill in the stomach; then to rise early in the
morning and get away unobserved.&nbsp; But by such a course of
action I should lose all chance of any further acquaintance with
those pretty girls!&nbsp; That they were already aware of the
extent of my predicament, and were now enjoying it&mdash;of that
I was quite sure.</p>
<p>What if I boldly put on the shooting-boots, and clattered down
to dinner in them?&nbsp; What if I took the bull by the horns,
and made, myself, the most of the joke?&nbsp; This might be very
well for the dinner, but it would be a bad joke for me when the
hour for dancing came.&nbsp; And, alas!&nbsp; I felt that I
lacked the courage.&nbsp; It is not every man that can walk down
to dinner, in a strange house full of ladies, wearing such boots
as those I have described.</p>
<p>Should I not attempt to borrow a pair?&nbsp; This, all the
world will say, should have been my first idea.&nbsp; But I have
not yet mentioned that I am myself a large-boned man, and that my
feet are especially well developed.&nbsp; I had never for a
moment entertained a hope that I should find any one in that
house whose boot I could wear.&nbsp; But at last I rang the
bell.&nbsp; I would send for Jack, and if everything failed, I
would communicate my grief to him.</p>
<p>I had to ring twice before anybody came.&nbsp; The servants, I
well knew, were putting the dinner on the table.&nbsp; At last a
man entered the room, dressed in rather shabby black, whom I
afterwards learned to be the butler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name, my friend?&rdquo; said I, determined
to make an ally of the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name?&nbsp; Why Larry sure, yer honer.&nbsp; And the
masther is out of his sinses in a hurry, becase yer honer
don&rsquo;t come down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he though?&nbsp; Well now, Larry; tell me this;
which of all the gentlemen in the house has got the largest
foot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it the largest foot, yer honer?&rdquo; said Larry,
altogether surprised by my question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; the largest foot,&rdquo; and then I proceeded to
explain to him my misfortune.&nbsp; He took up first my top-boot,
and then the shooting-boot&mdash;in looking at which he gazed
with wonder at the nails;&mdash;and then he glanced at my feet,
measuring them with his eye; and after this he pronounced his
opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer honer couldn&rsquo;t wear a morsel of leather
belonging to ere a one of &rsquo;em, young or ould.&nbsp; There
niver was a foot like that yet among the
O&rsquo;Conors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are there no strangers staying here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s three or four on &rsquo;em come in to
dinner; but they&rsquo;ll be wanting their own boots I&rsquo;m
thinking.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s young Misther Dillon;
he&rsquo;s come to stay.&nbsp; But Lord love you&mdash;&rdquo;
and he again looked at the enormous extent which lay between the
heel and the toe of the shooting apparatus which he still held in
his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I niver see such a foot as that in the
whole barony,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;barring my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Larry was a large man, much larger altogether than myself,
and as he said this I looked down involuntarily at his feet; or
rather at his foot, for as he stood I could only see one.&nbsp;
And then a sudden hope filled my heart.&nbsp; On that foot there
glittered a shoe&mdash;not indeed such as were my own which were
now resting ingloriously at Ballyglass while they were so sorely
needed at Castle Conor; but one which I could wear before ladies,
without shame&mdash;and in my present frame of mind with infinite
contentment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me look at that one of your own,&rdquo; said I to
the man, as though it were merely a subject for experimental
inquiry.&nbsp; Larry, accustomed to obedience, took off the shoe
and handed it to me.</p>
<p>My own foot was immediately in it, and I found that it fitted
me like a glove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now the other,&rdquo; said I&mdash;not smiling, for
a smile would have put him on his guard; but somewhat sternly, so
that that habit of obedience should not desert him at this
perilous moment.&nbsp; And then I stretched out my hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But yer honer can&rsquo;t keep &rsquo;em, you
know,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the ghost of
another shoe to my feet.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I only looked more
sternly than before, and still held out my hand.&nbsp; Custom
prevailed.&nbsp; Larry stooped down slowly, looking at me the
while, and pulling off the other slipper handed it to me with
much hesitation.&nbsp; Alas! as I put it to my foot I found that
it was old, and worn, and irredeemably down at heel;&mdash;that
it was in fact no counterpart at all to that other one which was
to do duty as its fellow.&nbsp; But nevertheless I put my foot
into it, and felt that a descent to the drawing-room was now
possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But yer honer will give &rsquo;em back to a poor
man?&rdquo; said Larry almost crying.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
masther&rsquo;s mad this minute becase the dinner&rsquo;s not
up.&nbsp; Glory to God, only listhen to that!&rdquo;&nbsp; And as
he spoke a tremendous peal rang out from some bell down stairs
that had evidently been shaken by an angry hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larry,&rdquo; said I&mdash;and I endeavoured to assume
a look of very grave importance as I spoke&mdash;&ldquo;I look to
you to assist me in this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Och&mdash;wirra sthrue then, and will you let me go?
just listhen to that,&rdquo; and another angry peal rang out,
loud and repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do as I ask you,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;you
shall be well rewarded.&nbsp; Look here; look at these
boots,&rdquo; and I held up the shooting-shoes new from
Burlington Arcade.&nbsp; &ldquo;They cost thirty
shillings&mdash;thirty shillings! and I will give them to you for
the loan of this pair of slippers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d be no use at all to me, yer honer; not the
laist use in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could do with them very well for to-night, and then
you could sell them.&nbsp; And here are ten shillings
besides,&rdquo; and I held out half a sovereign which the poor
fellow took into his hand.</p>
<p>I waited no further parley but immediately walked out of the
room.&nbsp; With one foot I was sufficiently pleased.&nbsp; As
regarded that I felt that I had overcome my difficulty.&nbsp; But
the other was not so satisfactory.&nbsp; Whenever I attempted to
lift it from the ground the horrid slipper would fall off, or
only just hang by the toe.&nbsp; As for dancing, that would be
out of the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Och, murther, murther,&rdquo; sang out Larry, as he
heard me going down stairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;What will I do at
all?&nbsp; Tare and &rsquo;ounds; there, he&rsquo;s at it agin,
as mad as blazes.&rdquo;&nbsp; This last exclamation had
reference to another peal which was evidently the work of the
master&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>I confess I was not quite comfortable as I walked down
stairs.&nbsp; In the first place I was nearly half an hour late,
and I knew from the vigour of the peals that had sounded that my
slowness had already been made the subject of strong
remarks.&nbsp; And then my left shoe went flop, flop, on every
alternate step of the stairs.&nbsp; By no exertion of my foot in
the drawing up of my toe could I induce it to remain permanently
fixed upon my foot.&nbsp; But over and above and worse than all
this was the conviction strong upon my mind that I should become
a subject of merriment to the girls as soon as I entered the
room.&nbsp; They would understand the cause of my distress, and
probably at this moment were expecting to hear me clatter through
the stone hall with those odious metal boots.</p>
<p>However, I hurried down and entered the drawing-room,
determined to keep my position near the door, so that I might
have as little as possible to do on entering and as little as
possible in going out.&nbsp; But I had other difficulties in
store for me.&nbsp; I had not as yet been introduced to Mrs.
O&rsquo;Conor; nor to Miss O&rsquo;Conor, the squire&rsquo;s
unmarried sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word I thought you were never coming,&rdquo;
said Mr. O&rsquo;Conor as soon as he saw me.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
just one hour since we entered the house.&nbsp; Jack, I wish you
would find out what has come to that fellow Larry,&rdquo; and
again he rang the bell.&nbsp; He was too angry, or it might be
too impatient to go through the ceremony of introducing me to
anybody.</p>
<p>I saw that the two girls looked at me very sharply, but I
stood at the back of an arm-chair so that no one could see my
feet.&nbsp; But that little imp Tizzy walked round deliberately,
looked at my heels, and then walked back again.&nbsp; It was
clear that she was in the secret.</p>
<p>There were eight or ten people in the room, but I was too much
fluttered to notice well who they were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; said Miss O&rsquo;Conor, &ldquo;let me
introduce Mr. Green to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It luckily happened that Mrs. O&rsquo;Conor was on the same
side of the fire as myself, and I was able to take the hand which
she offered me without coming round into the middle of the
circle.&nbsp; Mrs. O&rsquo;Conor was a little woman, apparently
not of much importance in the world, but, if one might judge from
first appearance, very good-natured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my aunt Die, Mr. Green,&rdquo; said Kate, pointing
to a very straight-backed, grim-looking lady, who occupied a
corner of a sofa, on the opposite side of the hearth.&nbsp; I
knew that politeness required that I should walk across the room
and make acquaintance with her.&nbsp; But under the existing
circumstances how was I to obey the dictates of politeness?&nbsp;
I was determined therefore to stand my ground, and merely bowed
across the room at Miss O&rsquo;Conor.&nbsp; In so doing I made
an enemy who never deserted me during the whole of my intercourse
with the family.&nbsp; But for her, who knows who might have been
sitting opposite to me as I now write?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, Mr. Green, the ladies will expect much
from an Adonis who takes so long over his toilet,&rdquo; said Tom
O&rsquo;Conor in that cruel tone of banter which he knew so well
how to use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget, father, that men in London can&rsquo;t jump
in and out of their clothes as quick as we wild Irishmen,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Green knows that we expect a great deal from him
this evening.&nbsp; I hope you polk well, Mr. Green,&rdquo; said
Kate.</p>
<p>I muttered something about never dancing, but I knew that that
which I said was inaudible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Green will dance,&rdquo; said
Tizzy; &ldquo;at least not much.&rdquo;&nbsp; The impudence of
that child was, I think, unparalleled by any that I have ever
witnessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in the name of all that&rsquo;s holy, why
don&rsquo;t we have dinner?&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mr. O&rsquo;Conor
thundered at the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Larry, Larry, Larry!&rdquo;
he screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yer honer, it&rsquo;ll be all right in two
seconds,&rdquo; answered Larry, from some bottomless abyss.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tare an&rsquo; ages; what&rsquo;ll I do at all,&rdquo; I
heard him continuing, as he made his way into the hall.&nbsp; Oh
what a clatter he made upon the pavement,&mdash;for it was all
stone!&nbsp; And how the drops of perspiration stood upon my brow
as I listened to him!</p>
<p>And then there was a pause, for the man had gone into the
dining-room.&nbsp; I could see now that Mr. O&rsquo;Conor was
becoming very angry, and Jack the eldest son&mdash;oh, how often
he and I have laughed over all this since&mdash;left the
drawing-room for the second time.&nbsp; Immediately afterwards
Larry&rsquo;s footsteps were again heard, hurrying across the
hall, and then there was a great slither, and an exclamation, and
the noise of a fall&mdash;and I could plainly hear poor
Larry&rsquo;s head strike against the stone floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ochone, ochone!&rdquo; he cried at the top of his
voice&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m murthered with &rsquo;em now
intirely; and d&mdash; &rsquo;em for boots&mdash;St. Peter be
good to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a general rush into the hall, and I was carried with
the stream.&nbsp; The poor fellow who had broken his head would
be sure to tell how I had robbed him of his shoes.&nbsp; The
coachman was already helping him up, and Peter good-naturedly
lent a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth is the matter?&rdquo; said Mr.
O&rsquo;Conor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be tipsy,&rdquo; whispered Miss O&rsquo;Conor,
the maiden sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I aint tipsy at all thin,&rdquo; said Larry, getting up
and rubbing the back of his head, and sundry other parts of his
body.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tipsy indeed!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he added
when he was quite upright, &ldquo;The dinner is sarved&mdash;at
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he bore it all without telling!&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
give that fellow a guinea to-morrow morning,&rdquo; said I to
myself&mdash;&ldquo;if it&rsquo;s the last that I have in the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shall never forget the countenance of the Miss
O&rsquo;Conors as Larry scrambled up cursing the unfortunate
boots&mdash;&ldquo;What on earth has he got on?&rdquo; said Mr.
O&rsquo;Conor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorrow take &rsquo;em for shoes,&rdquo; ejaculated
Larry.&nbsp; But his spirit was good and he said not a word to
betray me.</p>
<p>We all then went in to dinner how we best could.&nbsp; It was
useless for us to go back into the drawing-room, that each might
seek his own partner.&nbsp; Mr. O&rsquo;Conor &ldquo;the
masther,&rdquo; not caring much for the girls who were around
him, and being already half beside himself with the confusion and
delay, led the way by himself.&nbsp; I as a stranger should have
given my arm to Mrs. O&rsquo;Conor; but as it was I took her
eldest daughter instead, and contrived to shuffle along into the
dining-room without exciting much attention, and when there I
found myself happily placed between Kate and Fanny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew anything so awkward,&rdquo; said Fanny;
&ldquo;I declare I can&rsquo;t conceive what has come to our old
servant Larry.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s generally the most precise person
in the world, and now he is nearly an hour late&mdash;and then he
tumbles down in the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I am responsible for the delay,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not for the tumble I suppose,&rdquo; said Kate from
the other side.&nbsp; I felt that I blushed up to the eyes, but I
did not dare to enter into explanations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; said Tizzy, addressing her father across
the table, &ldquo;I hope you had a good run to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It did seem odd to me that young lady should call her father Tom,
but such was the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well; pretty well,&rdquo; said Mr. O&rsquo;Conor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I hope you were up with the hounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may ask Mr. Green that.&nbsp; He at any rate was
with them, and therefore he can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he wasn&rsquo;t before you, I know.&nbsp; No
Englishman could get before you;&mdash;I am quite sure of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be impertinent, miss,&rdquo; said
Kate.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can easily see, Mr. Green, that papa
spoils my sister Eliza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hunt in top-boots, Mr. Green?&rdquo; said
Tizzy.</p>
<p>To this I made no answer.&nbsp; She would have drawn me into a
conversation about my feet in half a minute, and the slightest
allusion to the subject threw me into a fit of perspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you fond of hunting, Miss O&rsquo;Conor?&rdquo;
asked I, blindly hurrying into any other subject of
conversation.</p>
<p>Miss O&rsquo;Conor owned that she was fond of
hunting&mdash;just a little; only papa would not allow it.&nbsp;
When the hounds met anywhere within reach of Castle Conor, she
and Kate would ride out to look at them; and if papa was not
there that day,&mdash;an omission of rare occurrence,&mdash;they
would ride a few fields with the hounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he lets Tizzy keep with them the whole day,&rdquo;
said she, whispering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has Tizzy a pony of her own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, Tizzy has everything.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
papa&rsquo;s pet, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whose pet are you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I am nobody&rsquo;s pet, unless sometimes Jack
makes a pet of me when he&rsquo;s in a good humour.&nbsp; Do you
make pets of your sisters, Mr. Green?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have none.&nbsp; But if I had I should not make pets
of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not of your own sisters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; As for myself, I&rsquo;d sooner make a pet of
my friend&rsquo;s sister; a great deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How very unnatural,&rdquo; said Miss O&rsquo;Conor,
with the prettiest look of surprise imaginable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all unnatural I think,&rdquo; said I, looking
tenderly and lovingly into her face.&nbsp; Where does one find
girls so pretty, so easy, so sweet, so talkative as the Irish
girls?&nbsp; And then with all their talking and all their ease
who ever hears of their misbehaving?&nbsp; They certainly love
flirting, as they also love dancing.&nbsp; But they flirt without
mischief and without malice.</p>
<p>I had now quite forgotten my misfortune, and was beginning to
think how well I should like to have Fanny O&rsquo;Conor for my
wife.&nbsp; In this frame of mind I was bending over towards her
as a servant took away a plate from the other side, when a
sepulchral note sounded in my ear.&nbsp; It was like the memento
mori of the old Roman;&mdash;as though some one pointed in the
midst of my bliss to the sword hung over my head by a
thread.&nbsp; It was the voice of Larry, whispering in his agony
just above my head&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;s disthroying my poor feet intirely,
intirely; so they is!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t bear it much longer,
yer honer.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had committed murder like Macbeth; and
now my Banquo had come to disturb me at my feast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it he says to you?&rdquo; asked Fanny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh nothing,&rdquo; I answered, once more in my
misery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There seems to be some point of confidence between you
and our Larry,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said I, quite confused; &ldquo;not at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not be ashamed of it.&nbsp; Half the gentlemen
in the county have their confidences with Larry;&mdash;and some
of the ladies too, I can tell you.&nbsp; He was born in this
house, and never lived anywhere else; and I am sure he has a
larger circle of acquaintance than any one else in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not recover my self-possession for the next ten
minutes.&nbsp; Whenever Larry was on our side of the table I was
afraid he was coming to me with another agonised whisper.&nbsp;
When he was opposite, I could not but watch him as he hobbled in
his misery.&nbsp; It was evident that the boots were too tight
for him, and had they been made throughout of iron they could not
have been less capable of yielding to the feet.&nbsp; I pitied
him from the bottom of my heart.&nbsp; And I pitied myself also,
wishing that I was well in bed upstairs with some feigned malady,
so that Larry might have had his own again.</p>
<p>And then for a moment I missed him from the room.&nbsp; He had
doubtless gone to relieve his tortured feet in the
servants&rsquo; hall, and as he did so was cursing my
cruelty.&nbsp; But what mattered it?&nbsp; Let him curse.&nbsp;
If he would only stay away and do that, I would appease his wrath
when we were alone together with pecuniary satisfaction.</p>
<p>But there was no such rest in store for me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Larry, Larry,&rdquo; shouted Mr. O&rsquo;Conor,
&ldquo;where on earth has the fellow gone to?&rdquo;&nbsp; They
were all cousins at the table except myself, and Mr.
O&rsquo;Conor was not therefore restrained by any feeling of
ceremony.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is something wrong with that fellow
to-day; what is it, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, sir, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he must be tipsy,&rdquo; whispered Miss
O&rsquo;Conor, the maiden sister, who always sat at her
brother&rsquo;s left hand.&nbsp; But a whisper though it was, it
was audible all down the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am; it aint dhrink at all,&rdquo; said the
coachman.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is his feet as does it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His feet!&rdquo; shouted Tom O&rsquo;Conor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I know it&rsquo;s his feet,&rdquo; said that
horrid Tizzy.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got on great thick nailed
shoes.&nbsp; It was that that made him tumble down in the
hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced at each side of me, and could see that there was a
certain consciousness expressed in the face of each of my two
neighbours;&mdash;on Kate&rsquo;s mouth there was decidedly a
smile, or rather, perhaps, the slightest possible inclination
that way; whereas on Fanny&rsquo;s part I thought I saw something
like a rising sorrow at my distress.&nbsp; So at least I
flattered myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send him back into the room immediately,&rdquo; said
Tom, who looked at me as though he had some consciousness that I
had introduced all this confusion into his household.&nbsp; What
should I do?&nbsp; Would it not be best for me to make clean
breast of it before them all?&nbsp; But alas!&nbsp; I lacked the
courage.</p>
<p>The coachman went out, and we were left for five minutes
without any servant, and Mr. O&rsquo;Conor the while became more
and more savage.&nbsp; I attempted to say a word to Fanny, but
failed.&nbsp; Vox faucibus haesit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he has got any others,&rdquo; said
Tizzy&mdash;&ldquo;at least none others left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the whole I am glad I did not marry into the family, as I
could not have endured that girl to stay in my house as a
sister-in-law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where the d&mdash; has that other fellow gone
to?&rdquo; said Tom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jack, do go out and see what is
the matter.&nbsp; If anybody is drunk send for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there is nobody drunk,&rdquo; said Tizzy.</p>
<p>Jack went out, and the coachman returned; but what was done
and said I hardly remember.&nbsp; The whole room seemed to swim
round and round, and as far as I can recollect the company sat
mute, neither eating nor drinking.&nbsp; Presently Jack
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; I always
liked Jack.&nbsp; At the present moment he just looked towards me
and laughed slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right?&rdquo; said Tom.&nbsp; &ldquo;But is the
fellow coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do with Richard, I suppose,&rdquo; said
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I can&rsquo;t do with Richard,&rdquo; said the
father.&nbsp; &ldquo;And will know what it all means.&nbsp; Where
is that fellow Larry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry had been standing just outside the door, and now he
entered gently as a mouse.&nbsp; No sound came from his footfall,
nor was there in his face that look of pain which it had worn for
the last fifteen minutes.&nbsp; But he was not the less abashed,
frightened and unhappy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is all this about, Larry?&rdquo; said his master,
turning to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I insist upon knowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Och thin, Mr. Green, yer honer, I wouldn&rsquo;t be
afther telling agin yer honer; indeed I wouldn&rsquo;t thin,
av&rsquo; the masther would only let me hould my
tongue.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he looked across at me, deprecating my
anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Green!&rdquo; said Mr. O&rsquo;Conor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yer honer.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all along of his
honer&rsquo;s thick shoes;&rdquo; and Larry, stepping backwards
towards the door, lifted them up from some corner, and coming
well forward, exposed them with the soles uppermost to the whole
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s not all, yer honer; but they&rsquo;ve
squoze the very toes of me into a jelly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was now a loud laugh, in which Jack and Peter and Fanny
and Kate and Tizzy all joined; as too did Mr.
O&rsquo;Conor&mdash;and I also myself after a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose boots are they?&rdquo; demanded Miss
O&rsquo;Conor senior, with her severest tone and grimmest
accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed then and the divil may have them for me,
Miss,&rdquo; answered Larry.&nbsp; &ldquo;They war Mr.
Green&rsquo;s, but the likes of him won&rsquo;t wear them agin
afther the likes of me&mdash;barring he wanted them very
particular,&rdquo; added he, remembering his own pumps.</p>
<p>I began muttering something, feeling that the time had come
when I must tell the tale.&nbsp; But Jack with great good nature,
took up the story and told it so well, that I hardly suffered in
the telling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Tom O&rsquo;Conor,
laughing till I thought he would have fallen from his
chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve got Larry&rsquo;s shoes
on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And very well he fills them,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s his honer that&rsquo;s welcome to
&rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Larry, grinning from ear to ear now that
he saw that &ldquo;the masther&rdquo; was once more in a good
humour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they&rsquo;ll be nice shoes for dancing,&rdquo;
said Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only there&rsquo;s one down at the heel I know,&rdquo;
said Tizzy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The servant&rsquo;s shoes!&rdquo;&nbsp; This was an
exclamation made by the maiden lady, and intended apparently only
for her brother&rsquo;s ear.&nbsp; But it was clearly audible by
all the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better that than no dinner,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you to do about the dancing?&rdquo; said
Fanny, with an air of dismay on her face which flattered me with
an idea that she did care whether I danced or no.</p>
<p>In the mean time Larry, now as happy as an emperor, was
tripping round the room without any shoes to encumber him as he
withdrew the plates from the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s his honer that&rsquo;s welcome to
&rsquo;em,&rdquo; said he again, as he pulled off the table-cloth
with a flourish.&nbsp; &ldquo;And why wouldn&rsquo;t he, and he
able to folly the hounds betther nor any Englishman that iver war
in these parts before,&mdash;anyways so Mick says!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Mick was the huntsman, and this little tale of eulogy from
Larry went far towards easing my grief.&nbsp; I had ridden well
to the hounds that day, and I knew it.</p>
<p>There was nothing more said about the shoes, and I was soon
again at my ease, although Miss O&rsquo;Conor did say something
about the impropriety of Larry walking about in his stocking
feet.&nbsp; The ladies however soon withdrew,&mdash;to my sorrow,
for I was getting on swimmingly with Fanny; and then we gentlemen
gathered round the fire and filled our glasses.</p>
<p>In about ten minutes a very light tap was heard, the door was
opened to the extent of three inches, and a female voice which I
readily recognised called to Jack.</p>
<p>Jack went out, and in a second or two put his head back into
the room and called to me&mdash;&ldquo;Green,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;just step here moment, there&rsquo;s a good
fellow.&rdquo;&nbsp; I went out, and there I found Fanny standing
with her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are the girls at their wits&rsquo; ends,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;about your dancing.&nbsp; So Fanny has put a boy
upon one of the horse and proposes that you should send another
line to Mrs. Meehan at Ballyglass.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only ten
miles, and he&rsquo;ll be back in two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I need hardly say that I acted in conformity with this advice,
I went into Mr. O&rsquo;Conor&rsquo;s book room, with Jack and
his sister, and there scribbled a note.&nbsp; I was delightful to
feel how intimate I was with them, and how anxious they were to
make me happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we won&rsquo;t begin till they come,&rdquo; said
Fanny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss O&rsquo;Conor, pray don&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but we will,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
have your wine to drink, and then there&rsquo;s the tea; and then
we&rsquo;ll have a song two.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll spin it out; see if
I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so we went to the front door
where the boy was already on his horse&mdash;her own nag as I
afterwards found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Patsey,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;ride for your life;
and Patsey, whatever you do, don&rsquo;t come back without Mr.
Green&rsquo;s pumps&mdash;his dancing-shoes you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in about two hours the pumps did arrive; and I don&rsquo;t
think I ever spent a pleasanter evening or got more satisfaction
out of a pair of shoes.&nbsp; They had not been two minutes on my
feet before Larry was carrying a tray of negus across the room in
those which I had worn at dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Dillon girls are going to stay here,&rdquo; said
Fanny as I wished her good night at two o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll have dancing every evening as long as you
remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I shall leave to-morrow,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Papa will take care of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so he did.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had better go over to
Ballyglass yourself to-morrow,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and collect
your own things.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no knowing else what you may
have to borrow of Larry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stayed there three weeks, and in the middle of the third I
thought that everything would be arranged between me and
Fanny.&nbsp; But the aunt interfered; and in about a twelvemonth
after my adventures she consented to make a more fortunate man
happy for his life.</p>

paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
